# Documentation

The following will outline, to some degree, how registration of content within `ModRegister` and all relative classes works. Generally speaking, the methods within these classes use standard methods of registering content to the game.

Do not rely on this as a form of Forge documentation. This is simply one method of how to perform certain actions, and some things may require additional steps done elsewhere.

I have grouped these registration methods by type to simplify and unify my registry standards across my mods. Too, to provide single instructions for repeatitive tasks.

For starters, to use these registry methods, you must use the `Init()` method defined in `ModRegister`. It takes a single argument of the mod name. This should be done within the constructior method of your `Main` class (or whatever you name your entry point). Such as:

```java
public Main() {
    config.Init("my_mod");

    FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus().addListener(this::setup);
    FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus().addListener(this::enqueueIMC);
    FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus().addListener(this::processIMC);
    FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus().addListener(this::doClientStuff);

    MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(this);
}
```

Without defining the name of the mod, the registry system will use the library name.

# Init
Upon initialization (running the `Init()` function), the mod ID is supplied to the class from the mod that imports this library. For example, a mod named "gemstones" would supply its mod ID to this init function.

Too, all events defined within the library are registered.

By default, all predefined events will be registered by the library, such as my example `BlockBreak` event used for replaceable, unbreaking blocks.

```java
private static String mod_id;

public static String getModId() {
    return mod_id;
}

public static void Init() {
    mod_id = Main.MOD_ID;
    
    events.put("block_break", BlockBreak.class);

    events.forEach((String key, Object event) -> Events.register(event));
}

public static void Init(String modId) {
    mod_id = modId;
    
    events.put("block_break", BlockBreak.class);

    events.forEach((String key, Object event) -> Events.register(event));
}
```

# Item Groups
Also known as creative tabs.

Item groups aren't actually registered to the game like other content items. Instead, they are defined by class and are used when registering content elsewhere.

These methods can be found under `Items`.

***

# Plants
Plants are simply a type of block that players can break in one hit and do not hinder movement... basically.

To make plants generate in a world you must provide a `Feature` that defines such an action. See `WorldGen`.
***

# Crops
Crops extend the `Block` class and are registered like any other block.

These methods can be found under `Plants`.

***

# Resources
I define resources as the collection of ores, tool materials, tools and other items that are mined or gathered to create various products.

**This content is WIP.**

### Ores
Ores are defined using the `OreBase` class and registered like any other block.

These methods can be found under `Ores`.

### Tool Materials
Tool materials determine the base definition of tools, such as their durability.

These methods can be found under `Tools`.

### Tools
There are two primary types of tools - usable and crafting.

Usable tools are items that revolve around a `ToolType` definition - `PICKAXE`, `AXE`, `SHOVEL` or `HOE`.

Craftable tools are usable in recipes and should have their purpose defined manually - like buckets. They are defined as "container items" and extend the main `Item` class.

# Blocks
I register blocks in a handful of ways, but it simplifies to the following:

```java
// The privare method that should not be referenced externally.
/**
 * 
 * @param name
 * @param block
 * @return
 */
private static Block _block(String name, Block block) {
    // Set the registry name of the block itself, not the item you can hold.
    block.setRegistryName(name);

    // Register the block to the Forge registry.
    ForgeRegistries.BLOCKS.register(block);

    // Add the block to the ModRegister blocks HashMap.
    ModRegister.blocks.put(name, block);

    // Return the block.
    return block;
}

// The publicly accessable method.
/**
 * 
 * @param name  The generic block name, like "my_block."
 * @param block The block instance.
 * @param group The creative tab the item should be grouped in.
 * @return Block
 */
public static Block register(String name, Block block, ItemGroup group) {
    Block b = _block(name, block);

    BlockItem itemBlock = new BlockItem(b, new Item.Properties().tab(group));
    Items.register(name, itemBlock);

    return b;
}
```

This method takes three arguments: `name`, `block` and `group`.
`name` is the block name, such as "custom_block" or "spruce_wood_chair."
`block` is the block itself, as stated by the expected type of `Block`.
`group` is the creative tab the block should be registered to. If the block you are registering should not be obtainable in creative mode, exclude this parameter and remove the `.tab(group)` portion of the first line.

`BlockItem itemblock` defines a new item based on the provided block.
When you create a new block, it doesn't actually have a "holdable" item until you create and register one. This is done by defining a `BlockItem` item based on the block you created. For this registry method, I use generic item properties. Because `BlockItem` takes in an argument of type `Item.Properties`, you can specify other item properties at this step. Too, you may choose to supply this property as an argument to the `register` method:

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param name       The generic block name, like "my_block."
 * @param block      The block instance.
 * @param properties Item properties for the ItemBlock item for the block.
 * @param group      The creative tab the item should be grouped in.
 * @return Block
 */
public static Block register(String name, Block block, Item.Properties properties, ItemGroup group) {
    Block b = _block(name, block);

    BlockItem itemBlock = new BlockItem(b, properties.tab(group));
    Items.register(name, itemBlock);

    return b;
}
```

Be sure to provide all content you create with unique and well-defined names. Don't use generic, non-descriptive names like "block1" or "aaaaa."

We register the item to the game using the `ForgeRegistries.IForgeRegistry<T>.register` method, as defined by `Items.register(name, itemBlock);`.

For blocks we use `BLOCKS` and items `ITEMS`, where `T` is `Block` and `Item` respectively.

I dislike having to recall content from registries, so I suggest storing your registered content in a collection of key-value pairs, such as a `HashMap<String, T>`, where `T` is the content type. For blocks, `T` = `Block`.

### Block Materials

Block materials aren't registered to the game and are instead defined by class, similar to creative tabs.

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param name           The generic material name, like "my_material."
 * @param color          The material color. See
 *                       <strong>net.minecraft.block.material</strong>.
 * @param isLiquid       Is the material a liquid? It cannot be liquid and
 *                       solid.
 * @param isSolid        Is the material a solid? It cannot be liquid and solid.
 * @param blocksMovement Does this material allow players to stand on it?
 * @param isOpaque       Does this material block light from passing through it?
 * @param flammable      Does this material burn?
 * @param replaceable    Can this material be replaced when a block is placed in
 *                       its space, like water does?
 * @param pushReaction   What happens when the block is pushed by a piston? See
 *                       <strong>net.minecraft.block.material</strong>.
 * @return Material
 */
public static Material registerMaterial(
    String name,
    MaterialColor color,
    Boolean isLiquid,
    Boolean isSolid,
    Boolean blocksMovement,
    Boolean isOpaque,
    Boolean flammable,
    Boolean replaceable,
    PushReaction pushReaction
) {
    // Define the new material.
    Material material = new Material(
        color,
        isLiquid,
        isSolid,
        blocksMovement,
        isOpaque,
        flammable,
        replaceable,
        pushReaction
    );

    // Add the new material to the HashMap.
    ModRegister.materials.put(name, material);

    return material;
}
```

This method is defined in the `Blocks` class.

### Block Properties
Here are the available properties of a block as defined by the `Block.Properties` class:
* `Material` material
* `Function<BlockState, MaterialColor>` materialColor
* `boolean` hasCollision = true;
* `SoundType` soundtype = `SoundType.STONE`
* `ToIntFunction<BlockState>` lightEmission = `(BlockState x) -> { return 0; }`
* `float` explosionResistance
* `float` destroyTime
* `boolean` requiresCorrectToolForDrops
* `boolean` isRandomlyTicking
* `float` friction = 0.6f
* `float` speedFactor = 1.0f
* `jumpFactor` = 1.0f
* `ResourceLocation` drops
* `boolean` canOcclude = `true`
* `boolean` isAir
* `int` harvestLevel = -1
* `ToolType` harvestLevel
    * `net.minecraftforge.common.ToolType`
* `Supplier<ResourceLocation>` lootTableSupplier
    * `java.util.function.Supplier`

* `AbstractBlock.IExtendedPositionPredicate<EntityType<?>>` isValidSpawn = `(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockReader, BlockPos blockPos, EntityType<?> entityType) -> { return blockState.isFaceSturdy(blockReader, blockPos, Direction.UP) && blockState.getLightValue(blockReader, blockPos) < 14; }`

* `AbstractBlock.IPositionPredicate isRedstoneConductor` = `(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockReader, BlockPos blockPos) -> { return blockState.getMaterial().isSolidBlocking() && blockState.isCollisionShapeFullBlock(blockReader, blockPos); }`

* `AbstractBlock.IPositionPredicate` isSuffocating = `(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockReader, BlockPos blockPos) -> { return this.material.blocksMotion() && blockState.isCollisionShapeFullBlock(blockReader, blockPos); }`

* `AbstractBlock.IPositionPredicate` isViewBlocking = `this.isSuffocating`

* `AbstractBlock.IPositionPredicate` hasPostProcess = `(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockReader, BlockPos blockPos) -> { return false; }`

* `AbstractBlock.IPositionPredicate` emissiveRendering = `(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockReader, BlockPos blockPos) -> { return false; }`

* `boolean` dynamicShape;

# Items
Registering items is exactly the same as registering an `ItemBlock` as descirbed previously.

```java
// Adds the item to the Forge registry.
/**
 * 
 * @param <T>  Any class that extends the Minecraft Item class.
 * @param name The generic item name, such as "my_item."
 * @param item The item instance.
 * @return Item
 */
public static <T extends Item> T register(String name, T item) {
    item.setRegistryName(name);
    ForgeRegistries.ITEMS.register(item);
    ModRegister.items.put(name, item);
    return item;
}

// A friendlier method of defining the creative tab for the item before registration.
/**
 * 
 * @param name       The generic item name, such as "my_item."
 * @param properties A set of properties defining the item.
 * @param group      The creative tab the item should be grouped in.
 * @return Item
 */
public static Item register(String name, Properties properties, ItemGroup group) {
    return register(name, new Item(properties.tab(group)).setRegistryName(name));
}
```

### Item Properties

Here are the available properties of an item as defined by the `Item.Properties` class:
* `int` maxStackSize = 64
* `int` maxDamage
* `Item` craftingRemainingItem
* `ItemGroup` category
* `Rarity` rarity = `Rarity.COMMON`
    * `net.minecraft.item.Rarity`
* `Food` foodProperties
* `boolean` isFireResistant
* `canRepair` = true
* `Map<ToolType, Integer>` toolClasses = `new HashMap<ToolType, Integer>`
    * `java.util.Map`
    * `java.util.HashMap`
    * `net.minecraftforge.common.ToolType`

* _`Supplier<Callable<ItemStackTileEntityRenderer>>` ister_
    * _`java.util.function.Supplier`_
    * _`java.util.concurrent.Callable`_
    * _`net.minecraft.client.renderer.tileentity.ItemStackTileEntityRenderer`_

Items cannot have damage and be considered stackable.
For a full definition of the `Item` class, see `net.minecraft.item`.

# Tools
***
**This is a WIP.**
***

As partially explained in the `Ores` section:

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param name       The generic item name, like "my_item."
 * @param properties A set of properties defining the item.
 * @param group      The creative tab the item should be grouped in.
 * @return Item
 */
public static Item registerCrafting(String name, Properties properties, ItemGroup group) {
    CraftingTool item = new CraftingTool(properties.tab(group));
    ModRegister.tools.put(name, item);
    return Items.register(name, item);
}

/**
 * 
 * @param name         The generic item name, like "my_pickaxe."
 * @param toolMaterial The tool material the item is defined to use.
 * @param toolType     The type of tool - pickaxe, shovel, axe, hoe.
 * @param level        The level of the tool.
 * @param group        The creative tab the item should be grouped in.
 * @return Item
 */
public static Item register(
    String name,
    ToolMaterial toolMaterial,
    ToolType toolType,
    Integer level,
    ItemGroup group
) {
    ToolBase item = new ToolBase(toolMaterial.getProperties().tab(group), toolType, level);

    ModRegister.tools.put(name, item);
    
    return Items.register(name, item);
}

```

When registering a new crafting tool, an item is created using the `CraftingTool` base and generic item properties. `CraftingTool` extends `Item` and is defined as:

```java
public class CraftingTool extends Item {
    public CraftingTool(Item.Properties properties) {
        super(properties);
    }

    @Override
    public ItemStack getContainerItem(ItemStack stack) {
        return stack.copy();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasContainerItem(ItemStack stack) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

This allows the item to be retrieved after crafting with it. Additional functionality and properties must be manually provided.

### Tool Material

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param name          The generic material name, such as "my_material."
 * @param level         The level of the tool material.
 * @param maxDamage     What is the max tool durability?
 * @param immuneToFire  Does this tool burn when you "Cast it into the fire!" ?
 * @param rarity        The item rarity of this material - common, uncommon,
 *                      rare or epic?
 * @param noRepair      Is this tool material repairable?
 * @param resource_type Is this material based on a gem, ingot or other
 *                      resource? Used by this library, NOT Minecraft.
 * @return
 */
public static ToolMaterial registerMaterial(
    String name,
    Integer level,
    Integer maxDamage,
    Boolean immuneToFire,
    Rarity rarity,
    Boolean noRepair,
    ToolMaterial.type resource_type
) {
    ToolMaterial material = new ToolMaterial(level, maxDamage, immuneToFire, rarity, noRepair, resource_type);

    ModRegister.toolMaterials.put(name, material);

    return material;
}
```

Tool materials define the base stats of tool items. As such, it is fairly important to consider when balancing items in your mod. If your material is supposed to mimic iron, you should provide material property values similar to iron's.

The argument `resource_type` is specific to my library and acts as a "definition" for the resource type - `gem`, `ingot` or `resource`. This is just a grouping method and does nothing to overall functionality.

***
# Foods
***
**This is a WIP.**
***

Registering new food items to the game is fairly simple. It is composed of two parts: the food definition and the item itself.

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param hunger     How many hunger points (20 for full) the food item rewards.
 * @param saturation How many saturation points (20 for full) the food item
 *                   rewards.
 * @return
 */
public static Food registerFoodNoItem(Integer hunger, Float saturation) {
    return (new Food.Builder()).saturationMod(saturation).nutrition(hunger).build();
}

/**
 * 
 * @param name       The food item name.
 * @param hunger     How many hunger points (20 for full) the food item rewards.
 * @param saturation How many saturation points (20 for full) the food item
 *                   rewards.
 * @param group      The creative tab the item should be grouped in.
 * @return
 */
public static Item registerFood(String name, Integer hunger, Float saturation, ItemGroup group) {
    Food food = (new Food.Builder()).saturationMod(saturation).nutrition(hunger).build();
    Item item = Items.register(name, new Item.Properties().food(food), group);
    ModRegister.foods.put(name, item);
    return item;
}
```

When creating a new food item, you must provide the basic properties of the food. For the sake of simplicity, my base methods are fairly generic. If you want additional properties of the food and / or item, you can copy the above code and recreate your own registry methods.

You should notice that the `registerFoodNoItem` and `registerFood` methods incorporate the same basic feature with their first lines in their bodies. This is required before the "make this item edible" part.

# World Gen
***
**This is a WIP and should be considered incomplete.**

### Features

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param name
 * @param feature
 * @return
 */
public static Feature<NoFeatureConfig> registerPlantGen(String name, Feature<NoFeatureConfig> feature) {
    return registerGenFeature(name, feature);
}

/**
 * 
 * @param name
 * @param entry
 * @return
 */
public static Feature<NoFeatureConfig> registerGenFeature(String name, Feature<NoFeatureConfig> entry) {
    entry.setRegistryName(new ResourceLocation(ModRegister.getModId(), name));
    ForgeRegistries.FEATURES.register(entry);
    ModRegister.generators.put(name, entry);
    return entry;
}
```

***
# Decoration

### Paintings

Paintings are defined by a registry name and a painting type. To register a new painting we must first register a new painting type. The default types provided in game are provided in `net.minecraft.entity.item.PaintingType`.

The `width` and `height` must be mod 16 (`width` / 16 has no remainder).

```java
// Defining a new PaintingType:
public PaintingType(int width, int height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
}

// So:
PaintingType paintingType = new PaintingType(16, 16);

// Registering it to the game:
/**
 * 
 * @param name     The painting name.
 * @param painting The painting instance.
 * @return PaintingType
 */
public static PaintingType registerPainting(String name, PaintingType painting) {
    painting.setRegistryName(new ResourceLocation(ModRegister.getModId(), name));
    ForgeRegistries.PAINTING_TYPES.register(painting);
    return painting;
}
```

***

# Events
Events are defined using a base class and take in an event "trigger," such as `final BlockEvent.BreakEvent event`. These methods are static and the class they are defined under should not have a constructor. Instead, each method should be annotated with `@SubscribeEvent`.

They can be registered using `Events`:

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param event The class that defines the event. See
 *              <strong>com.github.chrisofnormandy.conlib.event.BlockBreak</strong>
 *              for an example.
 */
public static void register(Object event) {
    MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(event);

}
```

Upon `ModRegister.Init()`, all events are registered to the game. The registration order of content is very specific, so doing a direct registration using the above method is ill advised. Instead, use `ModRegister.events.put("event_name", event);` `event` is provided as the class itself, such as `BlockBreak.class`.

***

# Additional Help
For those not well experienced in Java, much of what was explained above may be a bit confusing. Allow me to hopefully clarify some things and provide some brief insight.

### Suppliers
When you are attempting to create or register something and you get an error asking for a type `Supplier`, it is simply asking for something in the format of `() -> something` such as `() -> new Item(new Item.Properties())`. This is known as a "lambda expression," otherwise known as an "arrow function." It is represented as `Supplier<T>` where `T` is the type of the the result, such as `Supplier<Item>`.

To provide a simpler example, in JavaScript (not to be confused with Java used here, but for the sake of example) you can provide functions in various ways.

```js
function foo(arg, callback) {...}
```

where `callback` is a parameter of type `function`, you can supply it as

```js
foo(arg, function() { return ... });

// or

foo(arg, () => { return ... });
```

This principle can be applied to `Supplier` in Java.

### Packages
You are not required to organize your code by category or group, but it does help during debugging and logical readability.

For instance, having multiple files dedicated to creating blocks alongside files dedicated to creating items is not a great idea. It would be wise to sort your block related files into a directory `blocks` and items in `items`, or something of the sort. As such, your package names will change for each of your files. If you are using a smart IDE, this should be done automatically or may ask you if you would like to update package names and imports.

If not, the naming scheme should be similar to `package com.github.yourname.modname.blocks;`, where the path is `./src/main/java/com/github/yourname/modname/blocks/...`. The package naming scheme may be different depending on your preferences, but generally speaking the first three values should be `com`, `group` and `you`. `github` is a more "generic" group name and can be replaced with whatever you would like. Too, `yourname` can be anything you would like, but usually defines the author. See here for documentation on Java naming conventions: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html

### Enumerators
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html

The best way to describe a Java `enum` is as a class of properties that do not change. Essentially, it acts as a "collection" of values of a common type. For example:

```java
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY 
}
```

Each day within `Day` is a constant and is referenced like `Day.SUNDAY`.

You can provide details to each enumerated value by supplying additional properties to the `enum`. 

```java
public enum Planet {
    MERCURY (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6),
    VENUS   (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6),
    EARTH   (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6),
    MARS    (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6),
    JUPITER (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7),
    SATURN  (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7),
    URANUS  (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7),
    NEPTUNE (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7);

    private final double mass;   // in kilograms
    private final double radius; // in meters
    Planet(double mass, double radius) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    private double mass() { return mass; }
    private double radius() { return radius; }

    // universal gravitational constant  (m3 kg-1 s-2)
    public static final double G = 6.67300E-11;

    double surfaceGravity() {
        return G * mass / (radius * radius);
    }
    double surfaceWeight(double otherMass) {
        return otherMass * surfaceGravity();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 1) {
            System.err.println("Usage: java Planet <earth_weight>");
            System.exit(-1);
        }
        double earthWeight = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
        double mass = earthWeight/EARTH.surfaceGravity();
        for (Planet p : Planet.values())
           System.out.printf("Your weight on %s is %f%n",
                             p, p.surfaceWeight(mass));
    }
}
```

There are various examples of this style of enumeration throughout Minecraft.

### Annotations
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/basics.html

Primarily:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html

The `@Override` annotation will take an existing method and replace its body with whatever it is redefined to be. An example is shown in the next section.

If a class contains a method `a()`, and a second class extends the first class, you can redefine the method from the first class in the second class using `@Override a()`.

Interfaces are "abstract classes" that tend to have properties that may be shared across multiple classes without direct inheritance. That is, having a class `Truck` may extend a class `Automobile`, but we may have another class `Sedan` that extends `Automobile`.

If we have a method `horn()`, we may want to define the result for `Truck` differently than `Car`. To do so, we can provide an interface of generic, unset properties that we define later as needed.
`Machine`, for instance.

We can apply this interface to `Automobile` and define the `horn()` method within `Truck` and `Car` individually.

```java
public interface Machine {
    public Sound horn();
}

public class Automobile implements Machine {
    public Sound horn() {
        return Sound.NONE;
    }
}

public class Truck extends Automobile {
    @Override
    public Sound horn() {
        return Sound.HORN_TRUCK;
    }
}

public class Car extends Automobile {
    @Override
    public Sound horn() {
        return Sound.HORN_CAR;
    }
}
```

### Keywords
Some keywords are very important to know:

**Static** defines a method / class as being "unchanging," such that no other instance of it will ever be created. Static types are generally reserved for helper functions or build functions that do not require content initialization (you never do `new Class()` for static content). Consider static equal to "only one of this."

Static classes do not include a constructor.

**Final** defines a value as "unchanging" too, but in a different way. Final declares a property to be constant, meaning after it has an assigned value, at initialization, it will never change.

**Public** versus **Private**

Public declares a property as usable outside the class body. Private restricts the method as being only usable within the class body. By default, not providing either of these to a property will define it as private-like, where it is unreachable outside the class definition.

Public items should be limited to primarily constants and methods. All other things should be labeled private. If a value should be fetchable externally, a "getter" and / or "setter" method should be provided. For example:

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;

    public Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}
```

In this example, the name of the student is provided as a value in the constructor. After that point, the name cannot be changed, but it is able to be fetched using the `getName()` method. Notice how the constructor `Student(String name)` is public. At least one constructor should be made public for non-static classes.

You can always provide more than one constructor, but they must incorporate different parameter patterns.
That is:
```java
public class Foo {
    String a;

    public Foo(String x) {
        this.a = x;
    }

    public Foo(Integer x) {
        this.a = x.toString();
    }

    public Foo(String x, String y) {
        this.a = x + y;
    }
}
```

**Conditions** such as `if / else` statements should be reduced to a simplified form. There is a technique you may want to apply for such a thing called **Boolean Algebra.** It is best described as a reduction of comparisons.

To explain the symbols used:
∨ ( + ) means "or"
∧ ( * ) means "and"
¬ ( ' after ) means "not" and precedes the value.

These are written in Java as:
|| for "or"
&& for "and"
! for "not" and too precedes the value.

Thus:
`AB + C` = `(A * B) + C` = `(A ∧ B) ∨ C`
and
`AB' + C'` = `(A * B') + C'` = `(A ∧ ¬B) ∨ ¬C`
where ¬ denotes `true` becomes `false` and `false` becomes `true`.

Here is a table of conditional rules, where 1 = `true` and 0 = `false`:

| Law Name         | AND                           | OR                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Identity     | 1 * A = A                     | 0 + A = A                   |
| Null         | 0 * A = 0                     | 1 + A = 1                   |
| Idempotent   | A * A = A                     | A + A = A                   |
| Inverse      | A * A' = 0                    | A + A' = 1                  |
| Commutative  | A * B = B * A                 | A + B = B + A               |
| Associative  | (A * B) * C = A * (B * C)     | (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)   |
| Distributive | A + B * C = (A + B) * (A + C) | A * (B + C) = A * B + A * C |
| Absorption   | A * (A + B) = A               | A + A * B = A               |
| De Morgan's  | (A * B)' = A' + B'            | (A + B)' = A'B'             |

Of these laws, consider De Morgan's the most important to remember.

***
**If you end up in a situation where you have more than 3 to 5 `if` statements, consider using a `switch` statement.**
https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp

This will save a lot of execution time for long chains of "if this, else if this, else if this, etc..."

_Don't be like YandereDev... use a `switch` statement._
